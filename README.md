# PiCli

PiCli is a python client for PiedPiper, a CI-pipeline validation framework.

Additional documentation for PiedPiper can be found here: (https://piedpiper-picli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Getting Started

A local development environment can be configured using the following Ansible collection: https://github.com/AFCYBER-DREAM/ansible-collection-pidev/

Follow these instructions to turn a new machine into a PiedPiper development environment:

```bash
# the "org" variable should be the name of your Github.com organization
org="afcyber-dream";

# the "repo" variable should be the name of the repo containing your fork of afcyber-dream/ansible-collection-pidev
repo="ansible-collection-pidev";

# the "env" variable should be the nickname of the environment you wish to provision
env="ubuntu1804/dockerswarm+openfaas"

# once you have set these three variables, run this command as `root` (not a sudo user):
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${org}/${repo}/master/bootstrap.sh) ${org}/${repo} ${env}
```
Please refer to the README of that repository for further information.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6  
* (Optionally) virtualenv  
* PiedPiper OpenFaaS functions installed. (See above)


### Installing

#### Docker Installation

```
docker build -t picli .
docker run -it picli /bin/sh
```

#### Python installation
```
python setup.py install
```

## Using

To run PiCli:

#### Execute a lint

```
picli --config path/to/your/repo/piedpier.d/pi_global_vars.yml lint
```

#### Execute a validation

```
picli --config path/to/your/repo/piedpier.d/pi_global_vars.yml validate
```

### CLI Arguments

**debug**
```
picli --debug validate
```
Debug will dump PiCli's run_vars to the screen during execution. This allows
the user to validate PiCli's configuration that is being sent to the
various functions. 

## Running the tests

Currently we just have functional tests and linting tests. These require an OpenFaaS installation. The test script
can be found in tests/functional/run-tests.sh

To run the lint tests use tox: `tox -e lint`
